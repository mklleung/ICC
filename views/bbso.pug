    p.white As the first cultural club on the Brandeis campus with a legacy that predates the Intercultural Center, the Brandeis Black Student Organization (BBSO) has a history of facilitating cultural awareness and dialogues in social responsibility. In addition to coordinating creative and relevant programs and educating the campus about the rich diversity of international Africana cultures, its goal is to contribute to the academic and political issues that impact people of African descent around the world. The mission of BBSO is to create a safe space to promote friendship and solidarity among students while bridging gaps between communities.
