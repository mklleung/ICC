# ICC
This is a website that I am doing for COSI 152AJ-1. The ICC is Brandeis University's Intercultural Center, which houses 17 of the university's culture clubs/organizations. The goal of this website was to group all the clubs together and make a hub where they can post and let everyone know what events or news was happening. The target audience was towards first-years who might not know the culture clubs that Brandeis has to offer. This website features Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.
